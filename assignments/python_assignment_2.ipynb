    " Finally, also use comments to explain steps you are doing. no need to go overboard but it is always important in coding to be as descriptive as possible. Most things in this can be solved using methods shown in lecture. However, some cases will require you to search the internet for answers. This is intended because efficiently searching documentation or Stackoverflow is a requirement of modern programing. Finally, you'll notice this is already a python file, but all the questions are commented out. Add your answers (uncommented) in the approporate spot. Note that you will need to save this file in a NEW DIRECTORY, otherwise it will be conflict with whatever I put into this class repository. Some of you have asked if there is an elegant way to do this in verison control, and yes there is. You could fork the class repo to be your own and then edit it there, but this is not a requirement.\n",
